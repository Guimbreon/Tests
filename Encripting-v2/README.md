Now you can encript ANY message with this program! VERSION: 1.2

Encripting.py is here to help us encrip any message we want. It works in the following way:

	-It creates a "key" file that has the key to translate the thing u want to encript;
	-And it gives the user the encripted message!

Translate.py is the script used for translation! It works in the following way:
  
	-It will require the key file(from the Encripting.py script) and the Encripted message;
	-After u give the script that, it'll read it all and translate the message to us!
	
WHAT'S NEW'?
The Translate.py file is now with function!
